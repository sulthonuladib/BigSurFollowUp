# This is configuration for OpenCore latest commit

not recomended for daily use because not public release version of OpenCore and another dependencies like Lilu and friends

## Versioning

-   i will update for important kernel extensions every macOS beta update
-   you can use latest commit of for each required dependencies and compiled it by yourself
